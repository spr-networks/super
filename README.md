## Overview

Create an adaptive, micro-segmented network for managing WiFi devices, remote VPN access, and wired systems.

* One Password Per WiFi Device
* Policy Based / Zero Trust Network Access
* Per-Device DNS Rules & Ad Block Lists

## How it Works

An unspoofable device identity is established with a MAC address and Per-Device Passphrase for WiFi (or a VPN Public Key for Remote Devices). From there, each device gets its own /30 subnet to exist on. Hardening and strict firewall rules block network spoofing and impersonation, and routing rules redefine connectivity between devices and to the internet.

## Why SPR Over Alternatives

SPR is built to support an adapative, microsegmented network that unifies WiFi, DNS, Routing, and Policy. It's not easy to bolt on the concepts onto exising router stacks while also achieving high assurance security that blocks network spoofing attacks and other network flaws.

## Updating 
#### Building from scratch
```bash
./build_docker_compose.sh --load
docker-compose up -d
```

For performance and to minimize wear on SD cards, the build uses a memory-backed filesystem. On memory-limited devices, this can cause build failures if memory is exhausted. In this case, you can provide the build argument `--set "*.args.USE_TMPFS=false"`.


#### Using prebuilt containers
```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```
